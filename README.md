This is the website's main page! Users are able to explore through the game and learn how racist they truly are.

These screenshots exemplify how the game is set up. It quizzes the users on how racist they are and explains how each action is racist.

At the end, there's a meme or video that celebrates their completion. I used red and blue for the color scheme to mimic a police siren. At first, I thought it would be a game centered towards Black people, but racism could happen to anybody of any race.

The second of the website gives more of an explanation as to why the users should be careful about how they treat people who are different from them. It targets college students in the classroom, so that they could learn how to be more inclusive.

The morse code converter allows the viewer to type into the box and convert each character into a morse code.

This little game allows the user to guess how many rubber duckies are in hiding. After a guess, it will confirm whether they are right or not, and display how many of the colorful duckies that there are.

This website was still a work in progress with the other tabs, but I was able to experiment with the layouts and insertion of videos with coding!
