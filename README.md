This is the website's main page! Users are able to explore through the game and learn how racist they truly are.

Here is how the game is set up. It quizzes the users on how racist they are and explains how each action are racist. At the end, there's a meme or video that celebrates their completion. I used red and blue for the color scheme to mimic a police siren. At first, I thought it would be a game centered towards Black people, but racism could happen to anybody of any race.
