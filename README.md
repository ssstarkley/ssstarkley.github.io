This is the website's main page! Users are able to explore through the game and learn how racist they truly are.

These screenshots exemplify how the game is set up. It quizzes the users on how racist they are and explains how each action is racist.

At the end, there's a meme or video that celebrates their completion. I used red and blue for the color scheme to mimic a police siren. At first, I thought it would be a game centered towards Black people, but racism could happen to anybody of any race.

The second of the website gives more of an explanation as to why the users should be careful about how they treat people who are different from them. It targets college students in the classroom, so that they could learn how to be more inclusive.
